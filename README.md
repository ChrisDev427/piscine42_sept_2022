# piscine42_sept_2022

During the four-week 42 Piscine held in September 2022,
I worked on various projects and exercises in the C language, designed to teach me the fundamental concepts of programming,
such as loops, conditions, functions, arrays, etc.

The 42 Piscine is known for its project-based and peer-to-peer learning approach.
I was encouraged to work in teams, collaborate with other participants, and solve problems autonomously.

The 42 Piscine was a challenging experience, but it also provided an opportunity to develop my technical skills,
strengthen my resilience, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities in a creative manner.
